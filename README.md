just open the main and copy that code and it run properly.



Model:

Represents the primary entities in your system, such as Schedule, Device, EnergyUsage, and Database.
Each entity has attributes (e.g., deviceId, energyConsumed) and methods (e.g., turnOn(), calculateEnergyUsage()), indicating an object-oriented design approach.
Control Flow:

The interactions between objects (e.g., Schedule controlling operations of Device, Device storing data in Database) suggest a focus on data flow and functional responsibilities.
Components:

Clear separation of entities (models), their operations, and how they interact with the database aligns with typical MVC (Model-View-Controller) or layered architecture principles, though the view layer is not explicitly represented in your notes.
